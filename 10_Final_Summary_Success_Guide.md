## Interview Success Strategies

### 🎯 **Pre-Interview Preparation**

#### **24 Hours Before:**

- [ ] Review Quick Reference Guide (07_Quick_Reference_Guide.md)
- [ ] Practice explaining Frappe examples out loud
- [ ] Review Interview Cheat Sheet (08_Interview_Cheat_Sheet.md)
- [ ] Get good sleep (8+ hours)
- [ ] Prepare questions for the interviewer

#### **Day of Interview:**

- [ ] Light review of key concepts (30 minutes max)
- [ ] Practice explaining solutions out loud
- [ ] Arrive 15 minutes early
- [ ] Stay calm and confident

### 💡 **During the Interview**

#### **Problem-Solving Approach:**

1. **Listen Carefully**: Understand the problem fully
2. **Ask Questions**: Clarify requirements and constraints
3. **Think Out Loud**: Explain your thought process
4. **Start Simple**: Begin with brute force solution
5. **Optimize Gradually**: Improve step by step
6. **Test Your Code**: Check edge cases
7. **Discuss Trade-offs**: Explain your choices

#### **Communication Tips:**

- **Use Frappe Examples**: "In Frappe, we use hash tables for caching because..."
- **Explain Complexity**: "This has O(n) time complexity because..."
- **Discuss Alternatives**: "We could also use a tree, but hash table is better because..."
- **Show Understanding**: "The trade-off here is between memory and speed..."

### 🎯 **Common Interview Scenarios**

#### **Scenario 1: "Implement a function to find duplicate employees"**

```python
# Your approach:
def find_duplicate_employees(employees):
    """
    Find duplicate employees using hash table for O(n) time complexity.
    Similar to how Frappe caches user sessions for fast lookups.
    """
    seen = {}
    duplicates = []

    for emp in employees:
        if emp.employee_name in seen:
            duplicates.append((seen[emp.employee_name], emp))
        else:
            seen[emp.employee_name] = emp

    return duplicates

# Time: O(n), Space: O(n)
# Frappe example: Similar to _SITE_CACHE for O(1) lookups
```

#### **Scenario 2: "Design a caching system for document metadata"**

```python
# Your approach:
class DocumentMetadataCache:
    """
    Multi-level caching system similar to Frappe's _SITE_CACHE.
    Uses LRU eviction and TTL for optimal performance.
    """
    def __init__(self, max_size=10000, default_ttl=3600):
        self.cache = OrderedDict()
        self.max_size = max_size
        self.default_ttl = default_ttl
        self.expiry_times = {}

    def get(self, key):
        if key not in self.cache:
            return None

        # Check TTL
        if time.time() > self.expiry_times[key]:
            self._remove(key)
            return None

        # Move to end (LRU)
        self.cache.move_to_end(key)
        return self.cache[key]

    def set(self, key, value, ttl=None):
        if len(self.cache) >= self.max_size:
            self._evict_lru()

        self.cache[key] = value
        self.expiry_times[key] = time.time() + (ttl or self.default_ttl)
```

#### **Scenario 3: "How would you optimize a slow database query?"**

```python
# Your approach:
def optimize_employee_search(query):
    """
    Optimize employee search using multiple strategies:
    1. Database indexing for O(log n) lookups
    2. Caching for O(1) repeated queries
    3. Pagination to limit memory usage
    """
    # 1. Add index
    frappe.db.sql("CREATE INDEX idx_employee_name ON `tabEmployee` (employee_name)")

    # 2. Optimized query with LIMIT
    return frappe.db.sql(
        """
        SELECT name, employee_name, department
        FROM `tabEmployee`
        WHERE employee_name LIKE %s
        AND status = 'Active'
        ORDER BY employee_name
        LIMIT 20
        """,
        (f"{search_term}%",)
    )

    # 3. Cache results
    @frappe.cache(ttl=300)
    def cached_search(search_term):
        return optimize_employee_search(search_term)
```
